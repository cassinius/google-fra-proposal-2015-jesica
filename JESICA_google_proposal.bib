% Halevy is a key Google researcher and has 36k citations!!! If we win him - chances are good (he is related with Peter Norvig who is the boss there!)
% I have checked: Halevy is in research area "data management, info retrieval and the Web, data mining, natural language processing"
% NOTE: This must fit togehter with our selected two areas!!! Currently we have Machine learning and data mining and Software Engineering and programming languages
% Have a look at: http://research.google.com/pubs/author1112.html

% This is also a Halevy paper but includes his group, so highly necessary if we want to have them in favour, if somebody likes my group I like him :-)
% Are these Google Fusion tables useful?
